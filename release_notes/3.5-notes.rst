Jep 3.5 Release Notes
*********************
This release emphasized TODO.
It is compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.


Improved performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep now has improved caching of java.lang.Class and java.lang.reflect.Method
objects for faster performance overall.  The most notable speedups will be
seen when there are a large number of Java method invocations from Python.
