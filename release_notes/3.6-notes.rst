Jep 3.6 Release Notes
*********************
This release emphasized consistency and new features.  It is compatible
with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.


FreeBSD support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep can now be built on FreeBSD.


Improved method choosing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep now has improved method choosing when Python tries to call a Java
method that is overloaded.  Methods will be chosen based off of how closely
the Python inputs match the Java argument types.


Python initialization variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep now supports configuring global Python interpreter variables before
the Python interpreter has been initialized.  These global variables
correspond roughly to the Python command line arguments such as
python -B or python -E.  For more information, see the javadoc on PyConfig
and/or run python --help from a command line.  *Contributed by Jeff Stein.*


Improved Java memory efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep now manages local references more efficiently, freeing up Java heap
memory earlier for long running Python code.


Unsigned NDArray support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep now supports unsigned Python ndarrays transforming to/from unsigned
Java NDarrays.  *Contributed by Tim Verbelen.*


Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Jep is more efficient when transforming Python ndarrays to/from Java
NDArrays.
