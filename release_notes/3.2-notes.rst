Jep 3.2 Release Notes
*******************

Improved import hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Jep import hook is now more secure, using the supplied ClassLoader to load
Java classes.


JRE included classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep now ships with a list of classes included in the JRE.  This fixes an issue
with inconsistency on imports and enables commands like dir(java.util) from
the jep command line interpreter.
