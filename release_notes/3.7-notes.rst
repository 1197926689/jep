Jep 3.7 Release Notes
*********************
This release emphasized consistency and new features.  It is compatible
with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.


Shared NDArrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is now possible to share memory between Python and Java using direct
java.nio.Buffers and numpy ndarrays. The memory must be allocated by Java
using ByteBuffer.allocatDirect(). The direct buffer must be placed in a
jep.DirectNDArray before passing it to Python. Jep will convert the
DirectNDArray to a numpy ndarray referencing the same memory. If the numpy
ndarray is passed back to Java then the original DirectNDArray is passed back
and the memory remains shared. This provides faster data transfer between
Java and Python since there is no need to copy the memory. This can also
simplify any use cases that frequently transfer the same data between Java
and Python.
