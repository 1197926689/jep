Jep 3.7 Release Notes
*********************
This release emphasized consistency and new features.  It is compatible
with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.  Python 2.6 and 3.2 are no longer
supported.  Java 1.6 is no longer supported.


Shared NDArrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is now possible to share memory between Python and Java using direct
java.nio.Buffers and numpy ndarrays. The memory must be allocated by Java
using ByteBuffer.allocatDirect(). The direct buffer must be placed in a
jep.DirectNDArray before passing it to Python. Jep will convert the
DirectNDArray to a numpy ndarray referencing the same memory. If the numpy
ndarray is passed back to Java then the original DirectNDArray is passed back
and the memory remains shared. This provides faster data transfer between
Java and Python since there is no need to copy the memory. This can also
simplify any use cases that frequently transfer the same data between Java
and Python.


Improved unicode support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Strings that represent the full range of unicode values will now be passed
correctly between Java and Python. Previous versions of Jep had minor
inconsistencies for characters outside the range of US-ASCII and major problems
transforming characters outside of the Basic Multilingual Plane. The conversion 
was also optimized to avoid unnecessary intermediary charset encodings. 
Python 3 versions before 3.3 use a more complex unicode object than newer
versions of Python 3 so these versions are no longer supported. Unicode objects
are uncommon in Python 2 so Java Strings will be converted to UTF-8 encoded
Python string objects.


Added PyJAutoCloseable type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PyJAutoCloseable has been created to enable developers to more closely match
Python syntax when working with Java AutoCloseables.  The new type extends
PyJObject to retain all previous functionality.  This enables Python's "with"
keyword and ContextManagers to be used similarly to Java 7's try-with-resources.
For example:
::

    from java.io import FileWriter
    with FileWriter("/tmp/test.txt") as f:
        f.write("abc")


Synchronization on Java Objects within Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since every Java Object has an intrinsic lock associated with it, you can now
synchronize on Java Objects from within Python.  Every PyJObject has a
synchronized() method attached to it to enter the lock.  Developers should
always use Python's "with" keyword to ensure the lock is released when the
block of code is exited.
The Java code
::

    synchronized(obj) {
        // code here
    }

can be expressed in Python as
::

    with obj.synchronized():
        // code here

where obj is a PyJObject.
