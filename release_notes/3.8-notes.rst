Jep 3.8 Release Notes
*********************
This release emphasized...
It is compatible with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.  


Maven layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Jep source code and test code now follow a typical layout of Maven
projects.  The C code is organized following CPython's layout as a guideline.


Invoke using keyword args
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep.invoke() now supports keyword arguments when invoking Python functions.
It continues to support varargs arguments and also supports a combination
of positional arguments and keyword arguments.

Smarter library loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jep will try harder to find both the Jep library and the Python library so
LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and java.library.path are not needed in many
environments. There are 2 different changes that help with this:
1. Jep will now try to load the Python library globally which is required by some
   python modules. Previously this global loading was forced using LD_PRELOAD
   which is no longer necessary.
2. If the Jep Library is not found, then Jep will attempt to find it in the jep
   module. To find the Jep module it looks in the locations in the PYTHONPATH 
   environmental variable and also in the site-packages directory which is found
   relative to the PYTHONHOME environmental variable. If the Jep Library can be
   found in one of those locations then it is no longer necessary to set the 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH and/or java.library.path to the location of the Jep library.
